The process will appear stuck in background and you will never be able to see the full log. Instead, consider re-run without the trailing `| head` / `| tail` — the harness will capture all the stdout into a text file (instead of feeding directly into context) on completion. You can freely rg/Read on it for analyzing the log, with no worry about context flood.'
