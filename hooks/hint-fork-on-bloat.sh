# PostToolUse hook: hint about fork-first when this session's cumulative
# investigation tool output (Bash/Read/Grep/Glob) crosses ~50 KB.
#
# Threshold calibrated from 3-day session history (107 sessions):
#   p80 ≈ 54 KB; top 22% of sessions account for 80% of investigation
#   bytes (Pareto knee). Rounded to 50 KB so the hint fires on the
#   bloat-prone tail without nagging typical sessions.
#
# One-shot per session (matches no-head-tail-pipe.sh pattern) to avoid
# nag spam — after the first hint, the session has been reminded and
# repeats are silently allowed.

emit_post_tool_context "This session has spent ~${kb} KB on investigation tool output (Bash/Read/Grep/Glob). If you're surveying — count / breakdown / sweep / locate over a corpus, or smoke-testing with verbose output — consider forking the next batch via Agent (omit subagent_type to fork yourself). Intermediate fork output stays out of main context, so subsequent main turns re-read less. See CLAUDE.md 'Fork-first on Surveys'.
(One-shot hint — will not fire again this session.)"
